Summary. Many climate-relevant particle properties can only be measured reliably “in situ”—that is,
directly in the atmosphere. Such measured particle properties provide an essential constraint on remote
sensing observations and on model simulations. This chapter describes the wide range of instruments
that are used to measure particle microphysical and optical properties and how such measurements are
used to evaluate models.
The small size and low fractional contribution of aerosol particles to atmospheric material present
several substantial technical challenges. A large suite of instruments is often required to characterize
the multiple properties of atmospheric particles of relevance to climate, including physical properties
(size and particle mass and number concentrations), chemical composition, optical properties, and the
interaction of particles with water vapor to form hazes, cloud droplets, and ice particles. Many instruments are available, each employing different technologies with different practical considerations.
Some complex, labor-intensive measurements are better suited to “intensive” short-term measurements, while more autonomous instruments are suited to long-term monitoring.
Instruments have been deployed on a variety of platforms including ground stations, ships, and aircraft. Special attention must be paid to the design of the installation to minimize (or at least characterize) the losses of particles within the atmospheric inlet and the intervening line between the inlet and
the instrument. Special consideration must be paid to the line material, its geometry (bore and bends),
flow rate, and any splits or subsamples, relevant to the particle sizes of interest. Standardized methods
of dealing with these challenges are specified by programs such as the Global Atmosphere Watch
(GAW). Deployments of instruments on aircraft and ships present their own technical challenges related to the motion of the platform.
After measurements have been made, the data must be carefully and systematically processed to
ensure consistency, reliability, and ease of access. This includes providing data in the form of a usable
file type and with the appropriate metadata before submission to a database for distribution and
archiving. A few publicly accessible databases exist that collect long-term, in situ aerosol data from
around the world relevant for climate science including Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE), Aerosols, Clouds and Trace gases
Research InfraStructure Network (ACTRIS), In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System
(IAGOS), and the Global Aerosol Synthesis and Science Project (GASSP). Each of these includes a
defined protocol for the methods of data collection, processing, quality assurance, and archiving.

Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,375,"Chapter 9 Measurements of ambient aerosol properties
There are several important considerations in the comparison of in situ aerosol measurements
against models. Special care must be taken to define the units, whether “ambient” or “standard” volume
metrics are being used for mass and number concentrations, and the different definitions of particle
diameters, namely volume-equivalent, mobility, and aerodynamic diameters. These are properties
of the specific instrument used not only to perform the measurement but also to dictate the nature
of their impacts on atmospheric processes and climate. A significant challenge is that many in situ measurements are spatially and temporally discrete and particular care must be taken to ensure that this
does not bias any measurement-model comparison.
Large databases of many measurements in different locations and different times can provide a
valuable constraint on models. Several case studies of measurement-model comparison are presented
as examples of how in situ measurements have helped to improve models.
9.1 Measurement principles and instruments
While not offering the most extensive coverage of global atmospheric composition, in situ measurements provide unparalleled accuracy and intensity of measurement, albeit at a specific location and
time. In situ measurements are particularly valuable for aerosol because many important particle properties cannot be measured using remote sensing techniques (Chapter 10). In situ measurements are
technically challenging, not only because atmospheric particles are very small and carry little mass
but also because there are a very large number of climate-relevant properties. Many varied technologies
have been applied to this task (Hidy, 2019; Kreidenweis et al., 2019). Here, we summarize the properties measured and instruments used, along with best practice. For further reading regarding the fundamental principles of measurement, the reader is directed to Kulkarni et al. (2011) and Hinds (1999).
In Box 9.1, we provide a brief history of in situ aerosol measurements.
9.1.1 Units and particle diameter definitions
Before discussing the specific measurements, it is important to define the units and conventions normally used in the measurement and reporting of aerosol particles. Formalized conventions exist
(Section 9.3.1), although not all aerosol datasets conform, so this section covers the informal conventions used by the measurement community.
9.1.1.1 Concentration units
Particle concentration normally refers to the number of particles per unit volume of air (with units per
cubic centimeter, cm3) or the mass of a particular constituent per unit volume of air (in micrograms
per cubic meter, μg m3).
A key consideration when reporting or interpreting these quantities is the volume metric being
reported; often these will be referred to as “ambient” or “standard” concentrations. Ambient concentrations are those reported under the atmospheric conditions of temperature and pressure (hence air
density) of the measurement, whereas standard concentrations are adjusted to what would be measured
at standard temperature and pressure (STP), accounting for expansion, compression, heating, or cooling as necessary. The IUPAC preferred values are 273.15 K and 105 Pa (Calvert, 1990); however, other",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

BOX 9.1 History of in situ aerosol measurements
The first in situ measurements of atmospheric aerosol relevant to climate were made by Aitken in the late nineteenth century
(Aitken, 1888). His “condensation nucleus” counters used a rapid expansion to rapidly cool an air sample, causing particles
to form droplets that were countable optically. This formed the basis of modern condensation particle counters (McMurry,
2000b), and this innovation allowed new and important insights into the behavior of atmospheric aerosols and pollution
(Landsberg, 1934), the nature of cloud formation (Wilson and Thomson, 1897), and the presence of aerosol in the stratosphere ( Junge et al., 1961). Atmospheric particles with diameters around 50–100 nm are still referred to as the Aitken mode.
The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of many other counting instruments that could be deployed on research aircraft,
such as cloud condensation nuclei counters, optical particle counters, and cloud spectrometers (Knollenberg, 1981; Schuster
and Knollenberg, 1972; Squires and Twomey, 1966). These in turn facilitated many scientific advances in aerosol–cloud
interactions, in particular cloud brightening in response to anthropogenic emissions (Twomey, 1974).
Widespread monitoring of atmospheric aerosol began in the 1950s, as the quantitative linkages between poor air quality
and adverse health outcomes became established and legislation began to be imposed (Brimblecombe, 1987; Fowler et al.,
2020). This included measurements of mass concentrations and light attenuation of particulate matter collected on filters, but
these early urban measurements are of limited use for climate science. Later, measurements began to incorporate chemical
analysis (Friedlander, 1973) and size-resolved information, greatly facilitated by the development of mobility size spectrometers (Flagan, 1998; Whitby et al., 1972). In the 1980s, monitoring in rural areas started to become more common and
these also included measurements of particle composition and aerosol optical properties (Malm et al., 1994).
As further research was motivated into the role of aerosols in climate (e.g., Charlson et al., 1987, 1992; Penner et al.,
1994), more detailed, climate-oriented in situ measurements took place in the 1990s (e.g., Bates et al., 1998; Raes et al., 2000;
Sheridan et al., 2001). These also included the first measurements of atmospheric new particle formation (Kulmala et al.,
2004). By the end of the twentieth century, chemical composition measurements also reached a new level of maturity, with
the refinement of techniques for the analysis of the carbonaceous fraction, development of semicontinuous analyzers, and
online aerosol mass spectrometry (McMurry, 2000a; Noble and Prather, 2000; Turpin et al., 2000).
The subsequent proliferation and further development of these techniques (Laj et al., 2009) provided evidence of the
importance of organic aerosol in the atmosphere (Hallquist et al., 2009; Heald et al., 2008; Jimenez et al., 2009). Further
innovations in mass spectrometry have facilitated the study of the nucleation process on a fundamental chemical level
(Kulmala et al., 2014) and resolved the molecular composition of the organic fraction at the interface of the gas and particle
phases (Gentner et al., 2012; Heald and Kroll, 2020). In addition, the twenty-first century has seen developments of single
particle instruments for the online detection of black carbon and bio-particles (Huffman et al., 2019; Schwarz et al., 2006),
and improved measurements and understanding of the light-absorbing properties of carbonaceous particles (Bond et al.,
definitions exist; for instance EBAS (Section 9.3.2) defines standard pressure as 1013 hPa. Measurements adjusted to STP often prefix the volume unit with “s,” that is, s cm3 and μg sm3.
Standard concentrations remain constant as temperature and pressure vary. So for a well-mixed
boundary layer, a standard concentration will be the same at all altitudes, whereas the ambient concentration will decrease with altitude. Converting from standard to ambient requires knowledge of temperature and pressure as a function of altitude, so the conditions under which sampling was performed
should also be reported. A conversion between standard and ambient concentration may also need to
consider the partial pressure contribution from water vapor if measurements are made in a particularly
warm and humid environment (e.g., inside a tropical forest canopy).
9.1.1.2 Definitions of particle diameter
Measured particle sizes are typically reported as diameters but this is often an equivalent diameter
according to the measurement technique used. To compare data products or to relate them to a model,
conversions between these different diameters must be applied. The conventions used here are as",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,377,"Chapter 9 Measurements of ambient aerosol properties
defined by DeCarlo et al. (2004) and the reader is directed there for the physical principles and
derivations.
Volume-equivalent diameter, dv is the most basic definition of particle size and is defined as the
diameter of a sphere with the same volume as the particle in question. This is the basis for most aerosol
models and will be used as the basis for the size definitions here. It is not measured directly by any
instrument, but it can be calculated from the particle mass (mp), which is measurable using instruments
such as aerosol particle mass analyzers (Section 9.1.2.4), provided the particle density (ρp) is known:
sﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
The volume and density of the particle must be carefully defined when the particles may contain internal voids, for example, in soot particles.
Electrical mobility diameter, dm is reported by electrical sizing instruments (Section 9.1.2.4). For
spherical particles, dv can be assumed to be equal to dm. When considering nonspherical particles (e.g.,
soot, dust), a dimensionless dynamic shape factor (χ) is introduced, which reflects the increase in aerodynamic drag force relative to a sphere of equivalent volume. This quantity is 1 for spherical particles
and larger than 1 for nonspherical particles (Slowik et al., 2004; Tavakoli and Olfert, 2014). Because
many particle sizes are comparable to the mean free path (λ) of the gas molecules (66 nm in air at STP),
the Cunningham slip correction (Cc) is also included to account for deviations from Stokes’ law (Fuchs,
1964). These combine to form the following relationship:
1 Cc ðdv Þ
χ Cc ðdm Þ
The parameters in Cc(d) are empirically determined, with the NIST-preferred values being α ¼ 1.165,
β ¼ 0.483 and γ ¼ 0.997 (Kim et al., 2005). Explicitly accounting for this during a diameter conversion
requires a numerical solution of the function. While unnecessary for a sphere, the application of this
correction would account for an adjustment of 26% when calculating the dv of a particle with
Aerodynamic diameter, da is reported by instruments such as the Aerosol Particle Sizer
(Section 9.1.2.2), Aerodynamic Aerosol Classifier (Section 9.1.2.4), size-selective inlets
(Section 9.2.1), and cascade impactors (Section 9.1.2.1), which size particles according to their motion
and inertia in accelerating flows. da depends on χ and Cc as well as the density of the particle relative to
a reference value (ρ0), which is conventionally the density of water (1 g cm3). Because atmospheric
aerosol particles usually have a density greater than this (Cross et al., 2007), dv should not routinely be
equated to da. The aerodynamic diameter can be converted to dv as follows:
sﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Cc ðda Þ ρ0 χ
Cc ðdv Þ ρp
Note that χ has the opposite effect on da compared to dm. Because they are often considered in tandem,
ρp divided by χ is often referred to as the “effective density” (ρeff). For a particle of dv ¼ 100 nm and
ρeff ¼ 1.4 g cm3, the ratio of Cc values represents a correction to diameter of approximately 6%, but
this diminishes to 1% for a 1 μm particle, so depending on the accuracy required, this part of the calculation could be omitted for larger particles.",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,378,"9.1 Measurement principles and instruments
Vacuum aerodynamic diameter, dva is reported by aerosol mass spectrometers (Section 9.1.3.5)
and differs from da because the sizing is performed at a much lower pressure (typically on the order of
102 Pa), where λ is much greater than the particle diameter, therefore the particle drag force behaves
more in line with kinetic theory rather than Stokes’ law. This changes the definition as follows:
dv ¼ dva 0
Note that because χ is an empirical parameter, it is not intrinsically preserved across different pressure
regimes, so may differ between dva and da for a given nonspherical particle.
Optical diameter, do is sometimes referred to in the data products of optical particle counters
(Section 9.1.2.2); however this lacks a fundamental definition because the sizing is dependent on
the geometry of the instrument and the wavelength of light used. A particle’s reported diameter can
vary from dv due to variations in shape and refractive index, but the manner in which it does this will
be instrument-specific.
9.1.1.3 Size distributions
Many instruments report concentrations over a range of particle sizes (Fig. 9.1). It is conventional to
report size distributions as a function of logarithmic diameter. Because of technical limitations and
calibration issues, the specific diameters that instruments detect particles at are irregularly spaced
and are inconsistent between datasets and instruments. To make size distributions comparable, it is
standard practice to report them as a density function, also known as a differential size distribution
d(N(d))/dlog(d), that is, the number of particles per unit volume per log diameter interval of the size
bin (Kulkarni et al., 2011; Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016).
Some instruments report number concentrations within a size bin, so the differential quantity
d(N(d))/dlog(d) is calculated by dividing the number of particles in the bin by the logarithmic difference between the upper and lower bin boundaries, or log(dupper/dlower). The units of d(N(d))/dlog(d) are
the same as for the number concentration within a bin (e.g., cm3), as dlog(d) is dimensionless. Although base 10 logarithms are normally used (and usually specified by databases), natural logarithms
can occur, that is, d(N(d))/dln(d). To convert these to base 10 , they must be multiplied by a factor of
Particle number size distributions can be converted to a particle mass size distribution or d(M(d))/
dlog(d) by weighting each value by (π/6)ρpdcentre, where ρp is the material density (often assumed) and
dcentre is the geometric center of a size bin. This assumes the particles are spherical, so if particle shape
is known, this can also be included. Particle volume and surface area size distributions can also be
generated using their appropriate weightings.
9.1.1.4 Uncertainties, limits of detection, and time resolution
The measurement frequency and the certainty that can be attached to the measurement varies greatly
between the quantities being measured and the technique used. The term “time resolution” is used to
describe the time required to report a measurement. This can be because of the time taken to complete a
scan or the length of time generally required to collect enough material to analyze. However, many of
the instruments here can be described as “real time” measurements with no intrinsic time resolution
limit. Instruments that detect discrete particles, such as those measuring number concentrations, do
not have a fundamental detection limit in terms of the number of particles that must be present; however",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

Online and offline are terms used to define at what point a measurement is made. In an online
instrument, the measurement is made in real time and the aerosol sample is not collected, but its properties are measured as it passes through the instrument. An offline measurement means that the aerosol
particles are collected in some way (e.g., on a filter) and analyzed at a later time, for example, in a
laboratory.",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,380,"9.1 Measurement principles and instruments
The uncertainties associated with specific instruments can be highly complex. Instruments that
count particles follow a stochastic error model whereby the precision associated with a measurement
is proportional to the square root of the number of particles detected (the signal) and thus the signal-tonoise ratio is inversely proportional to this. The signal-to-noise ratio of an individual data point can be
improved by measuring for a longer time period. The uncertainty associated with offline analysis of
composition (Section 9.1.3) can vary greatly between techniques and laboratories. Precision and detection limits for offline analysis can be improved by sampling for longer, using a higher flow rate
sampler and in the case of cascade impactors, using fewer stages. Consequently, where values of detection limit and time resolution are given in this chapter, they should be treated as approximate, as
these may vary with the specifics of the instrument, operational protocol, and the environment they
are operated in. Approximate errors are given in Table 9.1, intended as indicative of typical measurements. Note that some modern networks (e.g., ACTRIS) specify higher tolerances than this, so it is
important to consult the technical documentation of a specific network when using data.

9.1.2 Measuring the mass, number, and size of particles
Some of the longest-standing measurements of aerosol particles concern the number or mass concentration, or particle size.
9.1.2.1 Gravimetric and equivalents
The particle mass concentration can be measured by pulling a known air flow rate through a filter over a
defined duration (typically around a day) and comparing the mass of the filter before and after. The
filter should be of a material and porosity that is known to collect 100% of particles at the flow rate
used. By dividing the collected mass by the volume of air sampled, a mass concentration can be
obtained. Because the particulate matter and the filter material may be hygroscopic, it is normal to
condition the filters (e.g., at 20°C, <40% RH) for a day prior to weighing.",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,382,"9.1 Measurement principles and instruments
If all particles are collected on the filter, this is known as Total Suspended Particulate (TSP), but
often it is preferable to report the mass of “fine” particles smaller than a certain size, as is the case in
health studies. This is normally performed by using a size-selective inlet (Section 9.2.1) ahead of the
sampling device and reported as “PMx,” where “x” (in μm) is the aerodynamic diameter at which 50%
of the particles are removed.
Size-resolved collection is possible using a cascade impactor in which particles are directed through
nozzles and deposited on a perpendicular surface through impaction. Depending on the air velocity,
pressure, and distance between the nozzle and surface, particles above a certain aerodynamic diameter
will attach to the collection surface. By using a sequence of impaction surfaces with progressively
lower distances and narrower nozzles, collection of material as a function of aerodynamic diameter
can be achieved (Berner et al., 1979; Marple et al., 1991). By way of example, the model 110 Micro
Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (MOUDI) collects particles over 11 logarithmically spaced stages
between 56 nm and 18 μm at a flow rate of 1.8 m3 h1.
For continuous monitoring, samplers can automatically expose filters according to a programmed
time interval (see Section 9.1.4). For real-time monitoring a Taped Element Oscillating Microbalance
(TEOM) will sense mass accumulation on a substrate through changes in its resonant frequency (Chung
et al., 2001). For semicontinuous measurement (as defined in Section 9.1.3), a beta attenuation monitor
(BAM) measures the reduction of beta radiation penetration through an exposed filter on a strip, which
is proportional to the mass of collected material.
General limitations of this technique are that time resolution is limited to (typically) daily for offline
analysis and hourly for online. While size fractionation is possible using cascade impactors and selective inlets, the amounts of mass present at diameters smaller than 100 nm is generally below detection
limit for gravimetric analysis in most atmospheric situations. Also, some particle components are semivolatile, so may exchange with the gas phase during sampling, handling, or conditioning, creating both
positive and negative artifacts (Hering and Cass, 1999).
9.1.2.2 Optical particle detection
Optical particle counters (OPC), Optical Particle Sizers (OPS), or Optical Particle Size Spectrometers (OPSS) detect particles through scattered light. These measure particles larger than around
200 nm diameter by drawing air into the instrument through an illuminated region (typically using a
laser beam) and detecting the individual particles as pulses of scattered light. In addition to reporting
a number concentration, a size distribution can be generated by measuring the size of the light pulses
(Kulkarni et al., 2011). Because the diameter of the particles is comparable to the wavelength of the
light used, resonances in the scattering function (Chapter 11) introduce inherent ambiguities in the response function of the instrument and therefore limit its sizing resolution (Szymanski and Liu, 1986).
Particle sizes expressed as do (Section 9.1.1.2) are usually calibrated to a traceable test aerosol, but
these are instrument specific and should not be treated as absolutely accurate.
OPCs have a low-diameter limit defined by the detection limit of the detector. The GRIMM model
1.108 portable aerosol spectrometer and TSI model 3330 Optical Particle Spectrophotometer (OPS)
can measure particles larger than 300 nm diameter, whereas the DMT Ultra High Sensitivity Aerosol
Spectrometer (UHSAS) can measure particles as small as 60 nm. OPC data can be used to estimate a
mass concentration (Section 9.1.3.1), but as assumptions must be made concerning shape and refractive
index, this should only be taken as indicative (Binnig et al., 2007).",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,383,"Chapter 9 Measurements of ambient aerosol properties
Aerodynamic Particle Sizers (APS), or Aerosol Particle Size Spectrometers (APSS) also detect
particles optically but use two light fringes to detect the velocity of particles after a nozzle expansion,
and thus infer their aerodynamic diameters (Section 9.1.1.2). For larger particles (>500 nm diameter),
this is an alternative means of determining diameter that is not subject to the complications associated
with scattering models (Baron, 1986). For smaller particles (>370 nm), they are still capable of optical
counting, but not aerodynamic sizing.
In situ measurements of cloud particles are performed to calibrate and validate remote sensing
products and directly study aerosol–cloud interactions (Baumgardner et al., 2011). Instruments such as
the Forward Scattering Spectroscopy Probe (FSSP) and Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP) are open-path
OPCs optimized for larger particles (>10 μm diameter) and are used to measure the number concentration and size of cloud particles (Brenguier et al., 1994; Faber et al., 2018). By using back- rather than
forward-scattered light, the backscatter cloud probe (BCP) eliminates the need to locate a probe outside
an aircraft’s fuselage, although it is not as accurate (Beswick et al., 2014). Total particle water content
can be measured independently of optical probes using a “hot wire,” where the current required to
maintain a resistively heated surface at a fixed temperature is related to the incident water’s latent heat
of vaporization (King et al., 1978).
The shape of ice and precipitation particles can also be detected by using multichannel detectors
(Baumgardner et al., 2017). These can measure the intensity of scattered light at different angles and/or
polarizations, recording the shadow of a cloud particle on a linear detector array as it passes through a
light curtain, or imaging a particle on a 2D array when it is illuminated by pulsed light source. Many
different instruments of these types exist and are suited to different sizes of cloud or precipitation particles, but examples include the Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP), Two-Dimensional Stereo probe (2D-S),
and Cloud Particle Imager (CPI). Because general-purpose comprehensive characterization is not possible with just one instrument, instruments like the Cloud Aerosol and Precipitation Spectrometer
(CAPS) work by combing multiple cloud sensors (Baumgardner et al., 2001).
9.1.2.3 Condensation particle counters
Condensation particle counters (CPC), or Condensation Nuclei Counters (CNC), use optical scattering to count aerosol particles that have been grown to larger sizes in a supersaturated vapor
(Agarwal and Sem, 1980; McMurry, 2000b). Most systems use butanol vapor to grow the particles
because it readily condenses on most particle types, although some systems use water (Hering
et al., 2005). The diameter at which a CPC detects particles at 50% efficiency is known as the lower
detection efficiency diameter or simply lower cut-off. The cut-off diameter depends on the specific
instrument but is typically between 2 and 10 nm (Sem, 2002), and particles only a few nanometers
larger should be detected with 100% efficiency. Well-maintained and calibrated CPCs have an accuracy of better than 5% and a very high precision in terms of signal-to-noise, as the number of particles
counted tends to be very high.
As a measure of the number concentration of particles, CPCs are regarded as more accurate than
OPCs because their lower cut-off diameter is smaller and better defined, but information concerning
size is lost. It is possible to obtain size-resolved data through the use of CPCs in combination with
diffusion batteries, but this technique is no longer favored (Knutson, 1999). Size-resolved information
can also be obtained by using a combination of CPCs with different cut-offs (Kulmala et al., 2007;
Williamson et al., 2018), which has the ability to delivery real time data, unlike scanned differential
classification (Section 9.1.2.4).",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

9.1.2.4 Particle size classifiers
Differential mobility analyzers (DMAs) can measure a complete particle size distribution by sizeselecting particles prior to counting. DMAs can size particles up to around 1 μm diameter, depending
on the design. Particles are charged using a bipolar ion field and then electrostatically drifted through a
laminar, particle-free sheath flow between two electrodes (Knutson and Whitby, 1975; Winklmayr
et al., 1991). The electrodes are normally in a coaxial cylindrical configuration, although others exist
such as radial or parallel plate (e.g., Amanatidis et al., 2020). Particles of a certain electrical mobility
diameter (Section 9.1.1.2), determined by the sheath flow rate and applied voltage, are extracted
through a slit in the opposing electrode and this monodisperse aerosol (containing particles of only
one size, as opposed to polydisperse) is then passed to another instrument for counting (Fig. 9.2).
Mobility Particle Size Spectrometers (MPSS) normally use a combination of a DMA and CPC,
although instruments with electrometer-based detectors also exist (Section 9.1.4). Common names include the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (DMPS) or
Scanning Electrical Mobility Spectrometer (SEMS). By using a fixed flow configuration and stepping
or scanning the DMA voltage, these generate a size distribution as a function of mobility diameter
(Flagan, 1998; Wiedensohler et al., 2012). Corrections must also be applied to account for the sizedependent bipolar charge distribution (ISO 15900) (Liu and Pui, 1974; Wiedensohler, 1988). If properly maintained and calibrated, these are generally regarded as highly accurate in terms of total number
and size, given that mobility diameter is equivalent to geometric diameter for spherical particles
(Section 9.1.1.2). A given unit will be able to cover a size range set by the size of the DMA and
the internal air flow rates, typically spanning a little over an order of magnitude in diameter space.
To cover a more extensive size range (e.g., 3 nm to 1 μm), it is common to run two systems in parallel
with different DMA lengths.
The sizing accuracy of most differential spectrometers should be better than 3% and around 5% or
better for number, reflective of the CPC used to detect the particles (Wiedensohler et al., 2018), but
additional uncertainties have been reported for particles smaller than 100 nm (Lepp€a et al., 2017;
Liu and Deshler, 2003). The number concentration precision is also intrinsically worse than for standalone CPCs, as fewer particles are being detected at any one time. The time resolution is limited by the
time taken to perform a scan, which is typically between 10 s and 10 min. While faster scan times are
often desirable, these reduces the accuracy of sizing (Mai et al., 2018).
Centrifugal classifiers such as the Aerosol Particle Mass analyzer (APM), Centrifugal Particle
Mass Analyzer (CPMA) and Aerodynamic Aerosol Classifier (AAC) allow particles to be studied
as a function of aerodynamic diameter or particle mass as opposed to mobility diameter (Broda
et al., 2018; Ehara et al., 1996; Tavakoli et al., 2014). While these have been applied to atmospheric
aerosol, their large moving parts mean they are not suited for routine monitoring.
9.1.3 Measuring chemical composition
In order to better understand the sources of particles in the atmosphere and their potential effects and
better inform and constrain climate models, it is necessary to measure the particle composition in addition to the mass concentration, number concentration, and size distribution. Methods of composition
measurement can be grouped into three general categories: offline, semicontinuous, and online. ""Offline analysis"" generally employs the same sampling systems used for gravimetric analysis such as filters or cascade impactors (Section 9.1.2.1), but the particulate matter collected can be subjected to",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

additional chemical analysis. ""Semicontinuous analysis"" employs the same principles as offline, except
an automated system analyzes the material collected in situ after a period of sample collection. The
advantage of this approach is that it increases the frequency of sample collection (typically hourly instead of daily) and eliminates problems associated with sample handling. However, this makes operation more complex and potentially less reliable. ""Online analysis"" eliminates the sample collection
phase entirely, performing direct chemical analysis in real time; however this is limited to certain analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry.
A wide variety of methods are available that are suited to different aspects of the composition with
the amounts of particulate matter needed to be collected ranging from micrograms to milligrams per
sample. The larger amounts can be obtained by sampling onto a filter for longer; however there are also
high-volume samplers that sample at a higher flow rate to increase the sample mass for a given sampling period. Common examples of automated filter samplers include the Partisol 2025i, which samples through 47 mm filters at up to 1.2 m3 h1 (a ""low-volume"" sampler), and the Digitel DHA-80,
which samples through 150 mm filters at up to 60 m3 h1 (a ""high-volume"" sampler).
The following are various techniques of composition measurement grouped according to the atmospheric particle types of interest, followed by a section on aerosol mass spectrometry, which is a more
general-purpose online technique. For further reviews of the specific methods, the reader is directed to
Laj et al. (2009), Chow and Watson (2013) and Johnston and Kerecman (2019).
9.1.3.1 Soluble ions
Several methods are available for offline analysis of the soluble inorganic fraction of aerosol particles,
originating from sea spray and the formation of secondary inorganic matter such as sulfates and nitrates. Filter or impactor samples (most typically taken from daily samples) can be extracted into deionized water (using sonication) and then analyzed using standard techniques such as ion
chromatography (IC) or UV–vis spectroscopy. This will deliver quantitative mass concentrations of
soluble inorganic ions present in the samples (sulfate, sodium, chloride, nitrate, ammonium, etc.) with
some small organic molecules (e.g., oxylate, methane sulfonate). This very common technique tends to
underestimate semivolatile components such as ammonium nitrate (Hering and Cass, 1999).
Direct sampling of aerosol into solution using steam-based systems avoids the potential for contamination or the evaporation of semivolatiles during sampling or handling of filters (Khlystov et al., 1995;
Weber et al., 2001). Examples include the Particle Into Liquid Sampler (PILS) and Steam Jet Aerosol
Collector (SJAC), which are used as collection devices in semicontinuous IC instruments such as the
Monitor for Aerosols and Gases in ambient Air (MARGA) or Ambient Ion Monitor (AIM) (Chen et al.,
2017). These report concentration data with a time resolution of hours, and some can report data on
gases and particles in tandem, but size-resolved measurements are not possible. Online and sizeresolved analysis is possible using aerosol mass spectrometers, although quantitative analysis is limited
to the non-refractory ions, so measuring sea salt is difficult (Section 9.1.3.5).
9.1.3.2 Mineral dust
Atmospheric mineral dust is difficult to quantify through chemical analysis because most components
of dust are not water-soluble. A common technique is the acid digestion of filter or impactor samples
followed by inductively coupled plasma analysis coupled with mass spectrometry or atomic (optical)
emission spectroscopy as the detector (ICP-MS, ICP-AES). This can deliver concentrations of metals
(e.g., iron, aluminum, potassium, etc.) which can be related to the mass concentration of dust if the",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,387,"Chapter 9 Measurements of ambient aerosol properties
mineralogy is known (Formenti et al., 2011). Metals can also be analyzed using various forms of spectroscopy such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Detection limits can be enhanced by using a high-intensity
source during offline analysis, such as a synchrotron (Bukowiecki et al., 2005) and semicontinuous
analysis is also possible (Tremper et al., 2018), which can deliver data on an hourly basis. Online analysis is possible with single particle aerosol mass spectrometry, although this is not quantitative for mass
Another common method for offline mineral dust analysis is subjecting samples to various forms of
electron microscopy, which is more feasible for dust particles than others because of their size and
robustness. This allows the morphology to be directly inspected and various spectroscopy techniques
can be employed to study the particle composition (Ault and Axson, 2017).
9.1.3.3 Carbonaceous components
Much of the atmosphere’s particulate matter is composed of carbonaceous material, which can be
broadly categorized as refractory soot, organic matter, and carbonates. While carbonate (originating
from mineral dust and sea spray) has a defined chemical form, definitions of the other fractions vary
and are largely operationally defined by a given measurement technique. There are various terms such
as ""elemental carbon,"" ""black carbon,"" and ""graphitic carbon"" that are often used to describe the refractory carbonaceous matter arising from combustion (i.e., the material that is not decomposed by
heat), however each definition has its own technical nuance, and they are not synonymous. For an authoritative discussion on the different definitions, the reader is directed to Petzold et al. (2013).
The total amount of carbon in a sample can be determined using thermal-optical analysis (Birch
and Cary, 1996; Cavalli et al., 2010). In this technique a sample is heated in an inert atmosphere to
measure the organic carbon (OC) and then again in an oxidizing atmosphere to quantify the elemental
carbon (EC). The mass of other elements in the organic molecules (in particular, oxygen, and hydrogen) is not measured so is not a strict mass measurement. The dividing line in the analysis between
organic and elemental carbon, known as the split point, is critical for quantification. Various protocols
exist for this analysis, the most common being IMPROVE, NIOSH, and EUSAAR-2 (Cavalli et al.,
2010). Samples are typically collected daily, but a semicontinuous version (Bauer et al., 2009) can
deliver data at a time resolution of hours. Much of the inaccuracy of the EC and OC data products stems
from ambiguities in the split point, particularly when the organic matter is involatile, as with biomass
burning. Semivolatiles may also cause both positive and negative artifacts (Schauer et al., 2003). Given
these effects are environment-specific, they are hard to generalize in the form of a single accuracy
statistic.
The organic fraction (defined as the fraction consisting of compounds containing carbonhydrogen bonds) can be analyzed in more detail through analysis of the molecular composition. This
can be done using a wide range of established laboratory techniques such as gas chromatography, liquid
chromatography, and mass spectrometry (Johnston and Kerecman, 2019; Nozière et al., 2015). There
are many challenges with this analysis, including difficulties in extracting certain species (in particular
oligomers), the lack of standards for unconventional molecules, and the sheer diversity of molecular
structures. Nevertheless, many hundreds of thousands of individual species can be observed in atmospheric particles. Spectroscopic analysis of bulk functionality is also possible (Decesari et al., 2000;
Russell et al., 2009). It is not generally possible to quantitatively account for all of the organic matter
present in the atmosphere on a molecular level, although recent advances in analytical techniques have
improved this substantially in recent decades (Heald and Kroll, 2020).",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,388,"9.1 Measurement principles and instruments
The amount of soot present on a filter sample is manifested in its darkness and this can be quantified in terms of the light reflection or transmission of a filter, which can in turn be used to infer ""equivalent black carbon"" or eBC. This technique formed the basis of metrics such as “black smoke” and
“coefficient of haze” used for urban air quality monitoring from the 1950s onwards (Quincey et al.,
2011; Wolff et al., 1983). Most modern measurements of this type perform analysis online by measuring light transmission through a filter as it collects a sample (Hansen et al., 1984; M€uller et al., 2011).
Examples include the Aethalometer, Multi Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP), Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP), and Tricolor Absorption Photometer (TAP). The Aethalometer and
MAAP use a reel-to-reel filter tape, which can be automatically advanced as a given section saturates,
making them suited for long-term automated monitoring. These instruments typically report with a
time resolution of around 5 min, with a lower detection limit of around 0.1 μg m3 eBC. The quantification of eBC is dependent on calibration factors and can be subject to several artifacts associated
with complexities of measuring light-absorbing particles on a filter (Collaud Coen et al., 2010).
Because some organic compounds absorb light at shorter wavelengths, the rate of change of attenuation at longer wavelengths (typically 660–950 nm) is usually used to calculate eBC, calibrated to EC
determined using thermal–optical analysis. Where instruments are capable of measuring at multiple
wavelengths, any absorption at shorter wavelengths (370–470 nm) over what would be expected for
the black carbon detected is ascribed to ""brown carbon"" (BrC). This can in turn be used to try to apportion the black carbon to different sources such as fossil fuel versus wood burning, the latter of which
has a higher BrC content (Sandradewi et al., 2008). BrC can also be measured through UV-Vis analysis
of solvated extracts (Wang et al., 2014).
The Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) is an online instrument that uses an active nearinfrared laser to selectively vaporize black carbon particles and the mass of ""refractory black carbon""
(rBC) can be determined on a per particle basis by observing the magnitude of incandescence as they
vaporize (Laborde et al., 2012; Schwarz et al., 2006). This instrument can provide quantitative rBC
number and mass concentrations in real time for testing models (Reddington et al., 2013). The SP2
has a lower cut-off of particles containing less than around 0.5 fg of rBC and an upper cutoff of around
1 pg of rBC where the detector either saturates or large particles are lost in the inlet system. Accuracy in
terms of mass is around 10%, although this may deteriorate if a large amount of rBC mass exists in very
small or very large particles. The instrument is also capable of inferring the overall size of particles
larger than approximately 150 nm diameter through detection of the light scattered as it enters the laser
beam, which can be used to infer mixing state and optical properties (Liu et al., 2017). It is also capable
of detecting iron oxides in dust particles (Section 9.1.3.2) as these also incandesce (Moteki et al., 2017).
9.1.3.4 Bio-particles
While data on organic carbon and specific molecules may indicate the presence of biological particles
such as bacteria, fungal spores, and pollen, for many purposes such as the study of ice cloud interactions
(Chapter 15), information on the precise nature of the particles such as biological species is needed.
Biological types can be determined through inspection of morphology in offline electron microscopy.
If enough sample is collected, biological assays such as culturing, gene sequencing, and omics-based
approaches can be used (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2019). To avoid contamination and to maintain viable
cells, specialist sampling equipment is available such as spore traps and liquid impingers.
Online bio-aerosol detection is feasible by employing the principle of fluorescence. Instruments
include the Waveband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor (WIBS) and Plair Rapid-C (Huffman et al., 2019).",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,389,"Chapter 9 Measurements of ambient aerosol properties
Particles are illuminated with ultraviolet light and emitted light at certain wavelengths is monitored,
corresponding to key molecules present in viable biological material. This multivariate data, along with
scattered light, can be used to deduce the nature of the particle using machine learning techniques,
noting that some nonbiological particles (e.g., those containing PAHs) are also capable of exhibiting
fluorescence. Some single particle mass spectrometers (Section 9.1.3.5) are also capable of detecting
bio-particles through analysis of mass spectral markers.
9.1.3.5 Aerosol mass spectrometry
The term ""aerosol mass spectrometer"" encompasses a range of instruments that use a form of mass
spectrometry to analyze particles online (Pratt and Prather, 2012). These instruments are by design
general purpose, although each technology has its own limitations, so they still do not represent a comprehensive characterization and are normally supplemented by other measurements.
The Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) works by continuously impacting particles on
a hot surface (600°C) under high vacuum and analyzing the vapors using electron ionization mass spectrometry (Canagaratna et al., 2007). The impaction is facilitated through the formation of a particle
beam by an aerodynamic lens, which is optimized for a certain aerodynamic size range; in its default
configuration, this is approximately 50–800 nm diameter, although a version able to detect particles up
to 2.5 μm is also available (Xu et al., 2017). The AMS in its standard configuration does not deliver data
on individual particles, but rather the overall ensemble. This includes quantitative mass concentration
data on the ""nonrefractory"" components such as the ammonium salts (sulfate, nitrate, chloride), sulfuric
acid and organic matter. The more refractory salts are not detected, so sulfate and chloride in sea salt
and nitrate in aged sea salt and dust are not measured. Data can be reported at a time frequency of
minutes or less with a detection limit of around 0.1 μg m3. By modulating the particle beam using
a chopper wheel, mass concentrations as a function of vacuum aerodynamic diameter can be delivered.
The AMS is also capable of quantifying organic particulate matter. While many organic molecules
will not directly vaporize at 600°C, the AMS will detect their pyrolysis products, so the overall mass
budget is conserved (Canagaratna et al., 2015). This, coupled with the high time resolution, has proved
valuable in constraining models of organic aerosol (Heald et al., 2011; Spracklen et al., 2011). Because
of the thermal vaporization, electron ionization, and lack of chemical separation, data on molecular
composition is not retained; however it is possible to obtain generalized metrics such as oxygen to carbon ratio (Aiken et al., 2008). It is also possible to separate the organic mass spectral data using Positive
Matrix Factorization, which can be used to quantify source contributions and chemical aging of secondary material ( Jimenez et al., 2009). However, while multiple types of oxygenated organic aerosol
are often reported by this analysis, such as “more oxygenated” and “less oxygenated,” these represent
the end points within a continuum of observed material within a given dataset and do not in themselves
represent discrete chemical types or are universally applicable to all datasets. That said, there are exceptions, such as detecting methane sulfonate or isoprene secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed
through the IEPOX pathway (Hu et al., 2015; Zorn et al., 2008).
The Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) is a variant of the AMS that is optimized for
long-term monitoring (Fr€
ohlich et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2011). While less expensive and less labor intensive, this sacrifices sensitivity, so the time resolution is typically minutes, data on organic elemental
ratios is less accurate and less information is obtainable through factorization (Fr€ohlich et al., 2015).
Single-particle mass spectrometers vaporize and ionize individual particles with powerful laser
pulses to measure refractory components of particles (refractory carbon, sea salt, mineral dusts). These",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

instruments deliver mass spectra on a per-particle basis so they can also measure particle mixing state
(Murphy, 2007). Examples include the Aerosol Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS), Single
Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SPAMS), Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectroscopy (PALMS)
and Laser Ablation of Aerosol Particles Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (LAAP-TOF). They can deliver real-time data, but due to matrix effects during the ionization process, generating quantitative mass
concentration data is difficult (Hinz and Spengler, 2007). Most single particle mass spectrometers employ
aerodynamic lenses that limit particle detection to a given aerodynamic size range, specific to each instrument. An additional detection limit is imposed by the need to trigger the desorption laser, which entails the detection of scattered light from a continuous wave laser source. This typically means that it is
limited to particles of around 300 nm diameter or larger, although some instruments have been specifically tailored to the study of nanoparticles (Pennington and Johnston, 2012).
Depending on the specific instrument used, it is normally possible to deliver elemental composition,
some molecular information, and possibly mineral phase (Marsden et al., 2018). The abilities of the
technique to detect and qualitatively identify dust and bio-particles and resolve mixing state makes
it particularly useful for studying interactions between aerosol and mixed-phase clouds (Creamean
et al., 2013). Numerical clustering algorithms are typically used to classify particles according to their
mass spectra and generate time series of particle classes (Rebotier and Prather, 2007). Some instruments are also capable of sizing particles by either measuring the intensity of scattered light from
the trigger laser or measuring the internal velocity to infer vacuum aerodynamic diameter (Salt
et al., 1996). Due to complexities of the instrument and volume of data generated, this type of instrument is not well suited for long-term monitoring.
Soft ionization inlets are a third class of aerosol mass spectrometer that deliver a wealth of (principally organic) data with a high (less than 1 hour) time resolution on the near-molecular level. The data
can either be inspected for specific molecules or processed using a multivariate analysis such as factorization. Examples used with Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS) include the semicontinuous Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosols (FIGAERO-CIMS) (Lopez-Hilfiker et al., 2014) and
Chemical Analysis of Aerosol Online (CHARON) (Eichler et al., 2015). The Extractive Electrospray
Ionization (EESI-TOF) is another example of an online soft source (Lopez-Hilfiker et al., 2019).
9.1.4 Measuring new particle formation
New particle formation is an important phenomenon to characterize and understand in the Earth system
(Chapter 5) and techniques have been developed to study this specifically. Measurement of new particle formation presents major challenges owing to the small size of the initial clusters and the rapidly
growing particles.
New particle formation events cause large numbers of particles to be evident in CPC
(Section 9.1.3.3) and mobility particle size spectrometer (Section 9.1.3.4) data. However, these must
be unambiguously differentiated from other sources of ultrafine particles such as from combustion.
When observed using a mobility particle size spectrometer, new particle formation events often manifest as a mode of small particles of a size starting at (as a minimum) the 50% detection efficiency
diameter of the CPC used, which increases in mobility diameter over time, often to several tens of nanometers. This pseudo-linear growth within a moving air mass (Chapter 5) shows as a curve when plotted
on a logarithmic diameter axis (Fig. 9.3), giving rise to the term “banana plots.” Protocols exist for their",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

interpretation in terms of particle formation and growth rates (Kerminen et al., 2018; Kulmala
The initial clusters formed by nucleation are challenging to study due to their small size (around
1 nm diameter) but they can be detected using the CPC principle if the initial growth uses a different
working fluid such as diethylene glycol (Kangasluoma and Attoui, 2019; Vanhanen et al., 2011). A
device such as a Particle Size Magnifier (PSM) can grow nanometer-size particles to around 90 nm
for subsequent detection by a CPC. Mobility particle size spectrometers such as the Neutral cluster
and Air Ion Spectrometer (NAIS) and Symmetric Inclined Grid Mobility Analyzer (SIGMA) use a similar principle to the DMA, separating charged particles by their electrical mobility, and Faraday cup
aerosol electrometers to detect small clusters (Manninen et al., 2016; Tammet, 2011). It is also possible
to study the composition of homogeneously nucleating particles using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure interface (APi-TOF), either studying charged clusters directly or after the chemical ionization of neutral clusters or gases (CI-APi-TOF) ( Jokinen et al., 2012;
Junninen et al., 2010). These have offered new insights into the nucleation process on a molecular level",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

9.1.5 Measuring aerosol particle optical properties
Particle optical properties are important for radiative transfer and also to assist in the inversion of remote
sensing data (Chapters 10 and 12) (Bohren and Huffman, 1998). The key in situ parameters are normally
expressed as Beer-Lambert coefficients (β) for a given wavelength, conventionally using units of Mm1
(inverse megameter) and are integrated through an atmospheric column to derive aerosol optical depth.
Secondary properties such as single scattering albedo (SSA) can be calculated from these and other parameters such as the per-particle cross sections and mass specific coefficients can be calculated when
combined with other data. Measurements at multiple wavelengths can be used to define the Ångstr€om
exponent and the approximate size of particles (Chapter 11). The measurements are normally with reference to filtered air, not a vacuum, so are strictly the particulate contribution to the optical properties, not
that of the overall aerosol, which should include the optical properties of the gases in the air.
The particle extinction coefficient (βext) can be determined directly using a high-finesse optical
cavity and measuring the ring-down time (the decay time of intensity) associated with a modulated
monochromatic light source (Langridge et al., 2011). This can also be manifested as a measured phase
shift on a square wave light source as used by the Aerodyne CAPS (Massoli et al., 2010). Depending on
the specific instrument, precisions of around 1 Mm1 on per-second data are possible and the accuracy
is generally taken to be very high, providing particles are consistently transmitted into the cavity.
The particle scattering coefficient (βsca) can be measured using an integrating nephelometer,
where particles are illuminated in a void and the scattered light over a defined solid angle is measured
(Heintzenberg et al., 2006). The total scattered light can be measured using an integrating sphere, as
used on the Aerodyne CAPS. Alternatively, scattering as a function of angle can be measured by using
multiple detectors as with the (now obsolete) TSI model 3563, or by sequentially illuminating different
areas of the void using a shutter, as with the Ecotech Aurora series. These are used to derive asymmetry
parameters used to model radiative transfer and remote sensing inversions (Andrews et al., 2006). A
fundamental limitation of this technique is that a detector cannot measure any scattering close to the
angle of incidence due to interference from the light source, which for particles much larger than the
wavelength, can be substantial. This is known as truncation and means that, in order to deliver an estimate of the true βsca, a correction must be performed based on a model of scattering, using data from a
collocated size distribution measurement or the wavelength and angle dependence of the signal.
The particle absorption coefficient (βabs) can be measured as the difference between βext and βsca,
but it is often desirable to be measured directly. This can be based on the attenuation through a filter as
described in Section 9.1.3.3, but quantitatively relating this to the true βabs is difficult owing to the
many complications associated with immobilizing the particles on a filter and transmitting light
through a filter medium (Bond et al., 1999; M€uller et al., 2011). However, while not the most accurate,
this technique is often desirable for monitoring due to its low cost and maintenance. The absorption
coefficient of particles can be measured in their aerosol form using photoacoustic spectrometry, where
an acoustic cavity and illuminated by a light source modulated at its resonant frequency and the
absorbed light energy (converted to heat) is detected as sound (Arnott et al., 2003; Lack et al.,
2012). Commercial versions of this include the DMT PAX, which also includes an inbuilt
nephelometer. A related technique is photothermal interferometry, where the absorbed light energy
is measured as changes to the surrounding air’s refractive index (Sedlacek and Lee, 2007). These techniques are capable of delivering data on a time resolution of seconds, however the measurement",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,393,"Chapter 9 Measurements of ambient aerosol properties
precision of βabs is generally quite low (around 1–10 Mm1), so atmospheric data must normally be
averaged to minutes or even hours, depending on the concentration.
9.1.6 Measuring water interactions
How particles interact with water vapor is crucial to understanding their effects on climate. Uptake of
water by particles increases their size, thereby affecting their optical properties (and thus radiative effects) and their ability to form cloud particles. Measurements of the particle–water interactions described below can be related to chemical composition using complex fundamental models or
simplified parameterizations such as κ-K€
ohler, depending on the application (Chapter 5).
The hygroscopic growth factor (the amount by which particles geometrically grow between two
defined relative humidities) can be measured using a hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA). Particles are selected by a DMA (Section 9.1.3.4) according to size at a low humidity
(typically RH <30%), conditioned to a higher humidity (typically 90%), sized by a second DMA before being counted by a CPC (Duplissy et al., 2009). By scanning both DMAs over the course of around
an hour, the ""growth factor"" or g(RH) can be calculated as the ratio of mobility diameters. The precision
of the reported g(RH) values is around 0.1 (Cubison et al., 2005). Some instruments are also capable of
scanning the RH of the second DMA, allowing the g(RH) to be calculated as a function of RH, which is
known as a humidogram, although this typically takes several hours to generate.
The effect of humidity on the optical properties, known as f(RH), can be determined by parallel
optical measurements at a dry humidity and at a higher humidity, e.g., with cavity ringdown or nephelometers (Langridge et al., 2011; Quinn et al., 2005). It is not possible to use photoacoustic or photothermal measurements of βabs in this manner due to artifacts caused by the water’s latent heat of vaporization.
While the f(RH) of absorption can be calculated from f(RH) measurements of extinction and scattering,
this can be inaccurate because of scattering biases associated with truncation (Section 9.1.5).
Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations can be measured using CCN counters (CCNC,
or sometimes simply CCN) by subjecting particles to a given supersaturation and detecting activated
particles using an optical particle counter (Roberts and Nenes, 2005). Supersaturated conditions are
created by heating a wetted surface in either a parallel plate or cylindrical configuration and exploiting
the fact that water vapor diffuses faster than heat in air, creating a supersaturated vapor front. This can
deliver the number concentration of potential CCN at a given supersaturation (from around 0.07% upwards, selected by controlling the temperatures). When operated downstream of a scanning DMA
(Section 9.1.3.4), size-resolved CCN number concentrations can be obtained, which in turn can be converted to the critical diameter for a given supersaturation or critical supersaturation for a given diameter
(Paramonov et al., 2015; Whitehead et al., 2014)—Chapter 12. Ice-nucleating particles (INP) can also
be detected using a similar principle (DeMott et al., 2017), although this is technically more challenging. INP can also be measured offline, by chilling particles immobilized on an impaction surface and
observing ice phenomena (see Chapter 15).
9.2 Conducting ambient measurements

the measurements are conducted, some of which will be informed by the science needs as much as the
measurement itself. Instruments must be calibrated and operated according to the manufacturer’s",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

summarizes the practical implications but for the in-depth theory, the reader is directed to Kulkarni
et al. (2011), Hinds (1999) and Vincent (2007). The reader is also directed to the formal Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) specification for aerosol measurement (WMO, 2016).
As almost all aerosol measurements entail introducing the sample into an instrument or sample medium, they must utilize some means of transferring the air to the instrument, particularly if the instrument is located some distance away from the sampling point (e.g., at the bottom of a sampling tower).
For the purposes of this discussion, the sampling point refers to the location where the air is draw in, the
inlet a device that facilitates the air sampling, and the line refers to the intervening tubing between the
inlet and the instrument.
9.2.1 Sampling points and inlets
When making ground-based measurements (Section 9.2.3) for climate-motivated studies, the sampling
point is typically located at a height of around 5–30 m to avoid any influences of the immediate vicinity
and provide a clear fetch in all directions, so is usually located on a building roof, or on a mast or tower
(Fig. 9.4). Note that sampling points for air quality monitoring tend to be lower to better represent human exposure. Sampling equipment that has no line (e.g., certain models of high-volume sampler) are
often located on elevated platforms or roofs, or generally away from buildings, trees or other obstructions and sources.

The function of an inlet is to ensure that particles of a defined size range are transmitted to an instrument or sampler. A common example in air quality science is the PM2.5 metric, which is designed to
represent the mass concentration of particulate matter that can penetrate to the alveolar region of the
lungs. This is performed by using a certified impactor or cyclone that removes larger particles, with the
cut point (defined as where particles are transmitted at 50% efficiency) at da ¼ 2.5 μm (Noble et al.,
2001). However, inlets such as PM10 are still used even when not explicitly required (e.g., when making
particle number size distribution measurements) to prevent the sampling of larger particles, which may
clog the instruments or otherwise perturb the measurement. If a size-selective cyclone or impactor is
not used, an inlet should still be shielded from rain and a mesh screen is often used to prevent insect
There are also special inlets designed to measure the particles that are left behind when cloud droplets are dried out (the residuals), for example counterflow virtual impactors (CVI) (Shingler et al.,
2012). These direct air flow at an inlet that is being supplied with particle-free air from the side such
that the air is stagnant at the tip. Cloud particles, because of their inertia, will pass through the stagnant
zone and dry out. The residuals can then be analyzed as normal aerosol particles.
9.2.2 Sampling lines and losses
Aerosol particles in a line are subject to undesirable loss mechanisms, namely electrostatic, diffusion,
impaction, and gravitational settling. The effect of the losses can be determined empirically by comparing the particle number size distribution measurements with and without the line, or through modeling. While well-established models exist for most of the processes (e.g., von der Weiden et al., 2009),
electrostatic precipitation, thermophoresis (particle migration due to temperature gradients) and flow
splits are hard to predict, so empirical calibration is also desirable (e.g., Birmili et al., 2007). An example of a comparison of modeled and measured line transmission curves is shown in Fig. 9.5.

Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf,396,"9.2 Conducting ambient measurements
Diffusion losses from Brownian diffusion toward the walls affects smaller particles the most (in
particular particles smaller than approximately 100 nm in mobility diameter). The loss is mitigated
by making lines shorter or increasing the flow rates. While increasing the bore of the line reduces
the surface-to-volume ratio, it also increases residence time for a given flow rate, so the effects cancel
out. However, wider lines do permit higher flow rates without a high pressure drop or inducing turbulence (see below). For measurements of nucleation in particular, lines are kept as short as possible. A
common configuration to help mitigate this is to have a large flow from the inlet through a wide-bore
tube, then to subsample the centerline of this flow (where losses are lower) before distributing air to the
instruments. Diffusion losses are enhanced by turbulence, so when smaller particles are of interest,
lines are generally operated with a laminar flow. This means operating at a low Reynolds number (less
than 2000) and keeping the inner surfaces of the line as smooth as possible, as even transient turbulence
can mix the aerosol and bring more particles into proximity of the inner surfaces. Diffusion is also
enhanced by thermophoresis, so unnecessary heating of the lines should be avoided. This also prevents
the loss of semivolatile components such as ammonium nitrate and certain organic components.
There are applications where a turbulent flow is preferred, as this can improve the transmission of
larger particles (Andrews et al., 2019). A plug flow profile is also desirable when making very fast
response measurements (e.g., eddy covariance), as this will reduce dispersion during the line transit
(Nemitz et al., 2008). In these situations, losses of smaller particles must be carefully characterized
and corrections applied as appropriate.
Electrostatic losses affect smaller particles more, but are hard to predict. These losses are normally
eliminated by ensuring inlets and lines are made of a grounded, conductive substance, usually stainless
steel. While copper is sometimes preferred as it is more ductile, it will corrode during prolonged use
(particularly at coastal sites), so is not suitable for permanent installations. In some installations, a
large-bore nonconductive polymer line is used for the major flow, but the centerline is subsampled
using a conductive material, as with diffusion loss minimization (Andrews et al., 2019). Conductive
flexible polymers, in particular carbon impregnated silicone, are also frequently used for lines and intermediate connections because of their convenience and versatility, but these may be undesirable for
some applications as they are known to emit volatile organic compounds that may perturb the measurement (Asbach et al., 2016; Timko et al., 2009).
Impaction losses mainly affect larger particles (over approximately 500 nm in aerodynamic diameter) and are caused by particles with high inertia leaving the gas streamlines as they change direction.
This can cause them to strike the internal surfaces, or leave the centerline of a laminar flow prior to a
subsample. These losses are mitigated by limiting the number of bends and splits in the line and where
bends are unavoidable, increasing the radius of curvature or reducing the flow velocity.
Gravitational settling occurs through heavier particles falling out of the air flow and again affects
larger particles. This is mitigated by increasing the flow rate, or having the line as an uninterrupted
vertical pipe.
The relative humidity of the air in the instrument can have a large effect on measured quantities
such as diameter. Some instruments (in particular those reporting size or total mass) are run at a low
humidity (typically RH <40%) to prevent hygroscopic growth, so the line air is often dried prior to
sampling (Gómez-Moreno et al., 2015; Tuch et al., 2009; Wiedensohler et al., 2012). Although it
may be desirable to size particles at ambient RH, active control of instrument RH is technically challenging and very high humidities can cause instruments to malfunction. It is therefore more common to
measure particles “dry” and refer to dedicated humidified instruments (Section 9.1.6) to predict their",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

Inlets present a particular issue for aircraft measurements. Small instruments can be mounted in
outboard pods (e.g., under the wings), but most will have to be inside the fuselage. This means that
lines must protrude out of the aircraft, with the inlet located at or as near the front as possible to minimize perturbations. The inlet itself must also be able to slow down the air (relative to the aircraft) while
not incurring significant losses. Solutions vary according to airframe, but a common method is to use a
diffuser cone (Fig. 9.6), which should ideally sample the air isokinetically and isoaxially, then subsequently expand it to slow it down (Hegg et al., 2005; Hermann et al., 2001). While these inlets generally
perform well for particles smaller than around 500 nm, they may concentrate particles of larger aerodynamic diameters (Huebert et al., 2004). The act of slowing will also increase the pressure, thus increasing the temperature and reducing the humidity (ram heating). Another issue is that at high
velocity, larger particles (in particular ones made of ice) striking the solid inlet may shatter and/or chip
off material from the inlet itself, which would lead to erroneous data (Murphy et al., 2004). For these
reasons, aircraft inlets must be very carefully characterized in a variety of conditions appropriate to the
application.
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and airships are also used for aerosol in situ measurements.
Airships are highly desirable because of their low speed (Rosati et al., 2016), although some air speed
must be maintained to prevent interference from any sources on the airship. Helicopters can deploy
instruments on a suspended package (D€
using et al., 2018). Advances in miniaturization have allowed",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

UAVs to be equipped with aerosol instruments (Bates et al., 2013), although space, weight, and power
requirements mean that the quality and range of data produced are inferior to what larger aircraft are
capable of. Smaller instruments have also been attached to tethered balloons (Renard et al., 2018), and
low-cost sensors can now be used on disposable balloon- or drop-sondes (Smith et al., 2019).
9.3 Data from in situ measurements
Data must be processed, quality assured, archived, and made available. In the case of long-term measurements, defined processes are normally in place for this, but “intensive” measurements are often
done in a more ad-hoc manner. However, it is increasingly a condition of receiving public funding
for research that data are made available that adhere to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable (FAIR) principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016).
9.3.1 Processing, file formats, and metadata
All in situ data must undergo a certain level of processing before usable data products can be submitted
to a database. This can include the removal of invalid data (due to technical failure, calibrations, and
maintenance), inversion of raw data (including corrections where necessary), and application of calibrations. The data should then go through a process of quality assurance, which can entail the application of statistical tests, comparison against external data sources, and manual inspection of the
ambient and diagnostic data to ensure, as far as possible, that the data are valid. Suspected “bad” data
(e.g., below detection limit) are normally “flagged” as such rather than removed, unless there is clear
evidence it is erroneous (e.g., equipment failure). Quality assured data are then assigned a unique identifier with version number so that if it is subsequently modified, there will not be conflicting versions of
the data in existence.
Data product levels are often assigned to indicate the amount of data processing that has occurred.
For instance, level 1 data may refer to the instrument’s native time base and units (Section 9.1.1),
whereas level 2 may have it mapped onto a prescribed grid and with specified units (e.g., standard volumetric concentrations; STP). Some databases may also permit the sharing of level 0 or provisional
data, which is the preliminary data (often produced automatically) that has not undergone full quality
assurance. The exact protocol and the quality assurance process will be specific to the instrument and
database in question and can originate from the instrument manufacturer, the data provider and/or the
database managers; however this information should be stored alongside the dataset or referred to in a
publicly accessible document.
File formats vary enormously, but there are some standards. Files are typically shared in simple
ASCII formats such as comma-separated variable (CSV) and NASA Ames files, which are more easily
handled by different systems and analysis tools. While easy to work with in small numbers, these file
formats quickly become cumbersome when large numbers of files are produced by different organizations with different conventions and is very inefficient for large amounts of data. The latest hierarchical data format (HDF5) provides an open specification and set of tools for storing and transferring
large (primarily scientific) datasets. Its data structure allows for multiple, nested, and optionally multidimensional variables or different types within a file. Specific variables, and chunks of variables, can
be accessed directly allowing extremely quick reading of subsets of data.",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

The World Meteorological Office (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme was set up
to monitor and distribute data pertaining to long-term changes to the atmosphere and wider Earth system (WMO, 2014), which includes an aerosol component. GAW consists of a network of global sites
from which data are contributed voluntarily according to agreed specifications and protocols. The sites

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a monitoring programme as

from urban air quality monitoring sites. Data can again be obtained at EBAS.
The Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air
Pollutants in Europe (EMEP) was formed in response to the Convention on Long-range Transboundary

In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) is a European Research Infrastructure for
global observations of atmospheric composition, which involves instrumenting commercial long-haul
aircraft for the purposes of collecting an extensive and long-term dataset, building on the previous
MOZAIC and CARIBIC projects (Petzold et al., 2015). There are two components: IAGOS-CORE,
where a relatively small package is permanently installed on a number of aircraft, and
IAGOS-CARIBIC, where a larger payload inside a cargo container is used periodically by a specific
aircraft. The dataset is far more extensive than those collected by campaigns on dedicated scientific
aircraft, albeit limited to the flight routes of the fleet. The data are of particular use in studies of
the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere and it also generates deep profiles during ascent and descent
phases (e.g., Martinsson et al., 2019). Data are available at 
The Global Aerosol Synthesis and Science Project (GASSP) was a UK-based project designed to utilize
intensive aerosol properties for the purpose of constraining climate models (Reddington et al., 2017).
Particular attention was paid to assembling surface and airborne data from various discrete measurement campaigns around the world that while potentially available on individual databases or through
direct communication with the investigators, were not subject to the same level of standardization as
the long-term datasets. This involved collecting the data and assigning a unified metadata scheme such
that the data could be queried in a consistent manner. This includes the time-dependent location data for
the aircraft and ship observations.
9.4 Modeling
The measurements described here are highly valuable for evaluating and improving the representation
of aerosol in models (Chapter 6). These in situ measurements provide directly comparable quantities
that do not rely on the assumptions required when using remotely sensing observations. In contrast to
satellite-based remote sensing observations however, in situ observations are necessarily very sparse in
space and time, which complicates model-observations comparisons.
9.4.1 Sources of error when comparing models and measurements
Data sparsity stems from both the extremely small (1 m) scale of the measurements which are many
orders of magnitude smaller than climate-scale processes, and the scarcity of the measurements themselves, which often require dedicated field campaigns. In this section we will discuss the effect of each
of these on model comparisons, which can lead to errors as large as 100% which easily swamp observational uncertainties, before addressing the practical steps which can be taken to best mitigate them.
9.4.1.1 Sub-grid-scale variability
There is a fundamental mismatch in the spatial scales at which the measurements described in this section are made (1 m) and the scales that aerosol models attempt to represent (1–100 km). Further,
while many aerosol models are run with a short time-step (minutes) the relevant fields are usually
only output averaged over days or even weeks, while measurements are often made much more",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

frequently (seconds to minutes). Airborne observations made during the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) experiment sampled both highly
heterogeneous aerosol conditions heavily influenced by local fire emissions and homogenous air
masses reflecting the large-scale background, allowing estimates of the spatial length-scales of aerosol
variability under different conditions (Shinozuka and Redemann, 2011). They found that under the influence of local emission sources the aerosol optical depth can vary significantly over scales of more
than 1 km, and away from such sources it varies significantly over scales larger than around 30 km
(Fig. 9.8). This is much larger than the scales of observations and much smaller than typically used
in GCMs, leading to potential biases when comparing with in situ observations that can remain even
after averaging. The assumptions used in many GCMs about the smoothness of the underlying fields at
grid-box scales can also lead to large biases in the model average (Weigum et al., 2016), but these are
distinct from the biases discussed here.
To quantitatively estimate these biases a “perfect” model experiment can be designed whereby a
high-resolution model is coarse-grained (spatially degraded) in order to estimate the effect of spatial
averaging. Recent work using a 10 km horizontal resolution model and comparing with 200 km spatial averages of the same underlying data has shown biases of 30%–160% in aerosol optical depth and
particle concentrations (Schutgens et al., 2016a). Given the relatively coarse 10 km model resolution
used, this is likely to be a low estimate of the bias, particularly near sources. They show that long-term
temporal averaging can reduce these biases to some extent but not alleviate them entirely.
As part of their evaluation of the representation of particle size distributions in a GCM using aircraft
observations, Watson-Parris et al. (2019) performed a perfect model experiment to investigate the effect of using different model temporal resolutions (Fig. 9.9). By comparing the model output interpolated to the flight locations in space and time from the shortest timescales resolved by the model
(7.5 min timestep) to 3-hourly, daily, and monthly averaged output they found that comparing observations of CCN (at 1% supersaturation) with monthly averages can reduce the correlation to <0.7 and
introduce biases of 15% or more. Moreover, this bias can be of different signs in different regions.
Schutgens et al. (2016b) have shown similarly large biases in comparing with monthly averaged fields.",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

From Watson-Parris et al. (2019).
Different aerosol particle properties have different temporal auto-correlation lengths and so will
produce difference biases at a given model resolution. These biases are also heterogeneous and depend
strongly on the proximity of local sources and sinks.
9.4.1.2 Measurement data sparsity in space and time
Given the sparsity of in situ aerosol measurements, an important question is how representative they are
of the wider atmosphere and hence over what scales can they be usefully averaged and compared with
their modeled counterparts. The degree of representativity of an aerosol measurement depends on the
strength of local sources and sinks, the meteorology, and topology. Another perfect model experiment
(Schutgens et al., 2017) estimated the representativity of black carbon surface concentration measurements over Europe (Fig. 9.10). The representation errors were found to be as large as 50%, much
larger than the measurement uncertainty. As above, local emissions and topography were large contributors to this source of error, and are very hard to correct for.
Other biases can occur due to specific sampling requirements of the instrument. For example, aerosol optical depth measured using sun photometers as used in the AERONET network require daylight
and clear skies. Due to covariation between clouds and aerosol, this sampling requirement can lead to a",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

Interestingly, the models showed a lower variability in their representation of droplet number concentration, Nd, compared to CCN number concentration, which was attributed to the sublinear relationship between CCN and Nd and the negative correlations between the sensitivity of Nd to CCN and to
updraft velocity. Although there was good agreement on the Nd between the models, there were larger
disagreements in the sensitivities, with important consequences for ACI forcing estimates.

budget (Spracklen et al., 2011)

large collection of in situ AMS measurements (Section 9.1.3.5) to evaluate the GLOMAP global chemical transport model. The authors explored the various contributions to SOA from biogenic (monoterpenes and isoprene), anthropogenic, and biomass burning volatile organic compounds by altering their

microphysical processes expected to control this bias and show that they are predominantly related to
aerosol particle aging and removal rather than emissions. In particular, the wet removal was shown to
be over-efficient in the model, particularly in the southern extra-tropics. A potential reason for this
over-efficiency is the assumption that aerosol mixes instantaneously across a grid box (Gryspeerdt
et al., 2014). This assumption is common to many GCMs and could have consequences for estimates
of aerosol-cloud-precipitation sensitivities and feedbacks.
9.4.2.4 The vertical profile of organic aerosol (Heald et al., 2011)
This study evaluated the representation of organic aerosol in a widely used aerosol model but with a
focus on the vertical distribution as measured by a large number of aircraft campaigns (Fig. 9.14). Similarly to Spracklen et al. (2011), they found that applying a large increase in anthropogenic SOA emissions was required in order to best match to observations near source. With the benefit of aircraft
measurements, however, they also found that this increase leads to an overestimate aloft and in remote
regions, suggesting either additional sinks of organic aerosol, or higher volatility at colder temperatures. They rule out wet removal biases in their model and instead decrease the enthalpy of vaporization
to improve their match with observations.
Each of these studies demonstrates the value of in situ observations for evaluating and improving
the representation of aerosol and aerosol particle processes in models, but also the difficulty in attributing biases to one particular process. Ultimately these observations should be combined with remote
sensing datasets for robust model evaluation.",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

behavior in the ambient atmosphere. Drying also becomes a general necessity when running in environments where the cabin temperature is lower than the ambient dew point (e.g., tropical) and liquid
water risks condensing in the line. Dry particle properties are also desirable for comparing with model
data because these properties are directly simulated, and the humidity in the model may not be consistent with the humidity in the sampled environment, which would introduce an inconsistency in the
comparison.
Drying is sometimes achieved through heating the line, but this potentially creates losses through
semivolatile evaporation and thermophoresis. A desiccant such as silica gel separated from the flow by
a mesh screen can be used; however this enhances diffusion losses and the desiccant must be changed
regularly. The generally preferred method used in monitoring is to flow the sample past a suitable
water-permeable membrane with a dry counterflow or vacuum on the outer side.
Flow splits and subsamples are sometimes necessary when distributing a sampled flow between
multiple instruments. However, these may also introduce losses and biases, for example, if larger particles impact on a bend or one instrument preferentially draws air from the centerline, where diffusion
losses are lower. Where necessary, these features should be properly designed and characterized.
9.2.3 Measurement platforms
Ground-based measurements mostly comprise automated measurement sites for air quality monitoring purposes and therefore principally in urban environments, although remote and rural sites are also
established for air quality, chemical transport and climate monitoring. Ground sites are often the subject of intensive measurement periods, which, while only producing data on a short period of time,
tends to be very detailed in scope, with a large number of complementary measurements (e.g.,
Bohnenstengel et al., 2015).
Marine measurements have been made extensively on research cruises (e.g., Baker et al., 2017;
Bates et al., 2008). Additional consideration must be given to eliminate interference from the ship itself, through impaction of ambient particles with the ship’s superstructure or sources such as the engine
and galley. It is generally desirable to place aerosol inlets as close to the bow as possible but to minimize line length, it may be necessary to house the instruments on or below the foredeck (e.g., inside
shipping containers). Alternatively, inlets and instruments can be placed above the wheelhouse. Even
with these precautions, it is usually desirable to filter the data for ship influences, for example, in a
tailwind or when turning. In addition to ships, measurements can also be made on buoys (Norris
Airborne measurements have been made extensively over many parts of the world as part of research campaigns as well as routinely on board a small number of commercial aircraft. The reader is
directed to Wendisch and Brenguier (2013) for more detail. Worldwide, many tens of fixed-wing,
piloted aircraft have been modified to carry aerosol and cloud instruments and make measurements
from near the surface to the lower stratosphere. Because of the motion of the aircraft, fast, online measurements are the most desirable. The spatial resolution itself is limited by the speed of the aircraft, with
slower speeds resulting in better resolution. However, the slower aircraft tend to have smaller payloads
and are limited to lower altitudes. Aircraft measurements are usually performed during discrete campaigns (e.g., Fehsenfeld et al., 2006), although longer-term data can be obtained on in-service commercial aircraft (Section 9.3.2).",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf

Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata provide a comprehensive set of metadata conventions specifically for climate- and weather-related phenomena. These specify specific coordinate names for common
variables such as latitude and longitude and a protected “standard name” attribute to uniquely identify properties such as relative humidity. They also enforce strict rules about the inclusion and formatting of units for
each variable. These conventions allow datasets to be widely shared and used without ambiguity.
9.3.2 Aerosol databases
Outside of routine monitoring, in situ measurements of aerosol are often performed on a campaignbasis
and therefore produce a discrete dataset rather than one that is continuously added to. While these are
often archived in general purpose databases, their nature means that assimilation for the purposes of a
more general measurement-modeling comparing exercise can be challenging.
A large number of systematic databases of in situ aerosol measurements exist, although most are
designed around air quality measurements. Listed here are several climate-relevant aerosol databases
providing rural and remote measurements. While this is not intended to be exhaustive, it does give some
of the higher profile and comprehensive in situ aerosol databases. Trends in aerosol properties from
some of these networks are described in Chapter 7. An example of the global distribution of data from
one database is shown in Fig. 9.7.

BOX 9.2 Practicalities of collocation and averaging
As described in Section 9.4.1 large errors can occur when comparing large-scale models against in situ measurements. These
broad classes of error can be minimized by following the same practice:
(1) Average the observations to remove the small-scale variability which the model cannot represent. This depends on the
spatial scale of the model being compared and the rate at which the measurements can sample that spatial scale. For
aircraft observations where the platform is moving at 100 m s1 comparing with a 100 km global model grid box would
suggest a roughly 2-min average. For a ground station longer averages might be appropriate.
(2) Filter the observations for sampling biases due to, for example, plume chasing, near-by emissions sources, or other
operational constraints.
(3) Use a tool such as the Community Intercomparison Suite (CIS; Watson-Parris et al., 2016) to linearly interpolate high
temporal resolution (daily or better) model output on to the locations of the observations.
(4) Average the resulting colocated model and observational values for as long as possible over as large regions as are
representative of the processes under investigation to remove as much remaining noise as possible.
These steps lead to comparisons which, as closely as possible, represent true model-observation differences.
alleviate this problem by providing more statistically robust sampling and consistent metadata information on the representativity of the measurements. A brief guide for how best to minimize these
sources of error is provided in Box. 9.2.
9.4.2 Case studies
In order to demonstrate the value of in situ measurements in identifying and understanding aerosol model
biases we briefly summarize four studies utilizing surface CCN number concentrations and composition
measurements as well as airborne particle number size distribution and compositional data.
9.4.2.1 Evaluation of global simulations of CCN and implications for cloud droplet
formation (Fanourgakis et al. 2019)
This comprehensive study of the particle size and sources of bias in surface CCN number concentration, and its effect on droplet number concentration (Nd) biases, used both a multimodel ensemble
(MME) to investigate intermodel differences and a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) to investigate
potential causes of bias in a single model (Fig. 9.11). The model diagnostics were designed to allow
accurate comparison with a large network of ground station measurements, primarily the Aerosols,
Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure (ACTRIS) network (Section 9.3.2), by outputting
model values at each station location at high temporal resolution.
As with many such evaluations they found a large spread in model estimates of CCN as compared to
the observations and found that no single model performs better against all observations, but there was
a consistent underestimation by the models. Detailed comparisons with the PPE were able to determine
the major sources of uncertainty in the modeled CCN number concentration (in the HadGEM3-UKCA
model at least) in the summer to be biogenic secondary organic aerosol formation and the hygroscopicity of the organic material, whereas dry deposition and cloud processing tend to dominate in
the winter.",https://drive.google.com/link/to/Aerosols_and_Climate.pdf
